/// Models a "Concentration" game
///
/// Concentration, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, or simply Pairs, is a card game
/// in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up
/// over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
/// Concentration can be played with any number of players or as solitaire. It is a particularly
/// good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.
